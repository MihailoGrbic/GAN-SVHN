# GAN_SVHN

In 2017. I did a research project at the Petnica Science Center, revolving around the idea of enlarging the training dataset for Street View House Numbers (SVHN) using GANs. As i didn't use Git at that time, a lot of the code is lost or buried in some old Linux partition. My goal for the following months is to slowly rediscover this lost code, polish it up (as my Python skills weren't the best at that time), and publish it here, so that it may be helpful to someone in the future.
